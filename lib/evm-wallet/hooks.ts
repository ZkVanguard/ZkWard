/**
 * EVM wallet hooks — wagmi bindings.
 *
 * Previously a disconnected shim (WDK removal groundwork). Now backed
 * by wagmi 3 with Hedera-primary chain config from ./wagmi-config.
 * All 12 dashboard files that imported from here keep working —
 * wagmi's hook API matches the shim shape we defined.
 *
 * The `disconnected shim` fallback still applies when the WagmiProvider
 * isn't mounted (marketing pages, SSR before hydration) — wagmi hooks
 * throw outside their provider, so we wrap each with a safe variant
 * that returns the disconnected shape instead.
